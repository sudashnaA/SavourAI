<h1>SavourAI</h1>
<p>SavourAI is an AI recipe generator that contains simple user interface and is designed for both desktop and mobile use<p>
<p>This frontend of this app was developed using HTML, CSS & Javascript. The backend was developed using Azure functions, all the functions were coded in Python & the database used was Azure CosmoDB. The AI model used was the OpenAI GPT-4o mini</p>
<p>The timeframe for development of the app was around 2 weeks, the login/signup pages + main theme was made in around 2 days. Then the main features ( recipe generation, saving recipes, dark theme ) took around 4 days to develop. Finally extra features such as collections, editing recipes & random recipes were developed in the final week alongside several UI improvements so the app works correctly on mobile. The UI Improvements that needed to be made were found via testing on several mobile devices.</p>
